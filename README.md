                                               RISC AND CISC 
					       
RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture)

•	RISC is to simplify the hardware by using instruction set consisting of operations like load, store etc. and also consumes less power. 
        In RISC each instruction in a single word.


•	RISC Architecture used in mobile phones.

CHARACTERISTICS OF RISC:

•	Simple instruction, so simple is the instruction decoding.

•	Instruction can fit into single word.

•	Instruction gets executed in a single clock cycle.

•	Less   complex .

ADVANTAGES:

•	Faster execution.

•	Simpler instruction.

•	Less power consumption.

 DISADVANTAGES:
    
•	More number of lines of codes.

•	High cost.

•	As the number of instructions increases, the memory space required to execute the instruction also increases.

CISC (Complex Instruction Set Architecture)

•	CISC consists of small lines of code and each line of code performing multiple tasks.

•	CISC Architecture is used computer, IOT devices.

	CISC-Software- simple, hardware –complex.

	RISC-Software-complex, hardware-simple.

  CHARACTERISTICS OF CISC:
  
•	Complex instruction.

•	Instruction  are larger than word size.

•	Instruction is not executed in a single clock cycle.

•	Complex instruction set.

   ADVANTAGE:
   
•	Reduced code size as multiple instruction are executed at same time .

•	As the lines of code , executes multiple instruction it memory space is less.

•	Most preffered.

DISADVANTAGE:

•	Slower execution.

•	More complex design.

•	Higher power consumption.

In a survey it is found that  , only 20% of instruction is used in Cisc.

Very few instruction refer memory.                                                                    



Few instruction .                                                                                                  



Highly pipelined.                                                                                       



Multiple register sets .                                                                                                    



Fixed format instruction .      


CISC


 Complex instruction taking multiple cycles

 
Most of instruction may refer memory.


Many instruction


Not pipelined


Single register set


Variable format instructions
